# 🌌 Aurora

**Innovating the web — one browser at a time.**

---

### 🧠 About Us
Aurora is a next-generation open web technology group creating privacy-focused, high-performance browser technology for everyone.

We believe the internet should be **fast**, **open**, and **beautifully simple** — not locked behind corporate walls.  
That’s why we’re building **Nibsium** and **Nimbus**, our own open web ecosystem powered by modern WebKit technologies.

### 🌐 Our Projects

A modular, lightweight browser engine built around **WebKitGTK** — open, embeddable, and designed for developers who want control over the web stack.

> _Nibsium is to Nimbus as Chromium is to Chrome._
