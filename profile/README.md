### 🧠 About Us
Aurora is a next-generation open web technology group creating privacy-focused, high-performance browser technology for everyone.

We believe the internet should be **fast**, **open**, and **beautifully simple** — not locked behind corporate walls.  
That’s why we’re building **Nibsium** and **Nimbus**, our own open web ecosystem powered by modern WebKit technologies.

### 🌐 Our Projects

#### 🧩 [Nibsium](https://github.com/AuroraWebCo/Nibsium)
A modular, lightweight browser engine built around **WebKitGTK** — open, embeddable, and designed for developers who want control over the web stack.

> _Nibsium is to Nimbus as Chromium is to Chrome._

#### ☁️ [Nimbus](https://github.com/AuroraWebCo/Nimbus)
A fast, elegant, and privacy-centered web browser built on **Nibsium**.
